#TAGS for Plays & Installing Application
#Ansible tags serve as markers that can be added to individual tasks within an Ansible playbook, 
#enabling the execution of specific or designated tasks based on these tags during playbook runs. 
#You'll occasionally need to execute only a portion of a playbook rather than the whole thing
